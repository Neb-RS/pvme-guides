__**Common mistakes made in combat and on gems and to fix them:**__
The following list (1 - 10) describes common mistakes made by players in pvm, bossing, or challenge gems. It is likely that if you're working on increasing your dpm, you will need to improve in one or many of these areas. The first step is recognizing what mistakes you're making, then working on the solution. Don't be discouraged if you don't get it right away, some of these mistakes are harder to fix than others. Remember, everything takes practice.

__**1. Cancelling channelled abilities late/early**__
⬥ Asphyxiate
⬥ Rapid Fire
⬥ Assault
⬥ Destroy
⬥ Concentrated Blast
⬥ Snipe
⬥ Fury
**Why it’s important:** Depending on what ability you canceled late, you will lose anywhere from 1-3 ticks every channeled ability you don’t cancel properly. As an example: in a 5-minute gem you will do roughly 10-12 Asphyxiates. Assuming you don’t cancel any Asphyxiates, that’s *30-36* ticks that you’re standing idle for. That’s enough time for 10 extra abilities. Canceling too early is also suboptimal as you lose out on the damage from the channeled ability.

__**2. Threshold order in Sunshine/Death’s Swiftness/Berserk with adrenaline potion**__
**Why it’s important:** for mage and range, the expected number of thresholds with adrenaline potion is 6. Losing out on a threshold results in big damage loss. For melee, the expected number with adrenaline potion is 2-3 (depends on how many channelled thresholds, Mutated Barge, or Impatient procs).
**How to fix:** Take a look in <#534567464370044928> <#563917498169425930> <#534912860711550989> to see the optimal threshold order.

__**3. Threshold order in Sunshine/Death’s Swiftness/Berserk without adrenaline potion**__
**Why it’s important:** For mage and range, the expected number of thresholds without adrenaline potion is 5. Losing out on a threshold results in big damage loss. For melee, the expected number without adrenaline potion is 2.
**How to fix:** Take a look in <#534567464370044928> <#563917498169425930> <#534912860711550989> channels to see the optimal threshold order.

__**4. Ability prioritization in Sunshine/Death’s Swiftness/Berserk**__
**Why it’s important:** Ultimates are the bread and butter to obtaining a high dpm. Using the right abilities inside an ultimate will make or break getting that high dpm goal.
**How to fix:** Familiarize yourself with which abilities you should prioritize at any given time: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OetEUz4xU5sg7pqmJBkkafmZIye8qoPOXprUPGhin14/edit?usp=sharing
.
__**5. Lossless auto-attack at the start of Sunshine/Death’s Swiftness/Berserk**__
Two scenarios: missing the auto-attack altogether OR getting an auto-attack, but it’s a dual wield auto-attack.
**Why it’s important:** It’s a lossless damage boost (lossless meaning no ticks lost) that’s often overlooked.
**How to fix:** Use a dual wield ability before activating Sunshine/Death’s Swiftness/Berserk. Immediately after activating your ultimate, switch to a 2h and click on the target to obtain a free auto attack before the gcd is over. Clicking the target is only necessary if you clicked your Planted Feet/2h switch from your inventory. If you keybound everything, disregard clicking the target; the auto-attack will come with no extra input needed.

__**6. Utilizing flanking in basics rotation**__
**Why it’s important:** Remember that basic Impact-Flanking is a 260% ability and is **better than Dragon Breath** in terms of damage. Not utilizing Flanking in a basics rotation is losing out on using your best-damaging basic attack.
**How to fix:** Practice, practice, practice. Make an effort to use your Flanking switch more often.

__**7. Ability prioritization in basics rotation**__
**Why it's important:** Prioritizing weak abilities over strong abilities when choosing the next ability just leads to lower damage.
**How to fix:** If on revolution, take a look at the official RS Wiki and set up an optimized revolution bar. For full manual, take a look at this spreadsheet and familiarize yourself with what abilities are better damage and therefore should be prioritized. https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OetEUz4xU5sg7pqmJBkkafmZIye8qoPOXprUPGhin14/edit?usp=sharing
.
__**8. Managing cooldowns of good abilities**__
Using and putting all the good abilities on cooldown right away and being stuck with only weak basics afterwards.
**Why it’s important:** The good abilities (Dragon Breath, Impact-Flanking, Corruption Blast, Snipe, Binding Shot-Flanking, Corruption Shot) often come with a long cooldown. If you use all the good abilities at once, you will be stuck with the lower damage abilities until all the good abilities are back off cooldown. 
**How to fix:** By using ‘filler’ abilities such as Sonic Wave <:Sonic:535533809924571136>, Concentrated Blast <:Conc:535533833106489365>, Dazing Shot <:Dazing:535541307142307860>, Needle Strike <:Needle_Strike:535541259108876293>, Fury <:Fury:535532879510372352> <:Mut_Fury:535532879334080527>, Cleave <:Cleave:535532878616985610>, and Decimate <:Deci:535532879325822986> (abilities that have decent damage with a short cooldown) in-between the strong abilities, you can craft a rotation where you will never run into a scenario where you have to resort to low damage abilities.  

__**9. Losing ticks**__
This can be caused by: a) not inputting the next ability fast enough, b) having trouble determining what is the next ability, c) clicking and/or being slow on weapon switches
**Why it’s important:** Same rationale as canceling channeled abilities. Losing ticks here and there will snowball over the course of a 5-minute gem.
**How to fix:** Practice, practice, practice. Try and think two abilities ahead and plan out your rotation. 

__**10. Changing weapons mid-channel ability**__
**Why it’s important:** By changing from a wand and orb to staff mid-Concentrated Blast you will lose the crit bonus from the Concentration Blast. This requires precise timing to make sure you’re still getting two hits from your Concentration Blast. Moreover, this resets your auto-attack cooldown which is bad for 4taa
**How to fix:** Just don’t do it.
